            I am results-oriented professional with five years of experience in COBOL development, now returning to the tech industry after a six-year period focused on personal and professional growth. 
            During this time, I have maintained and further developed my problem-solving, attention to detail, and collaboration skills. I am eager to re-enter the field of technology and transition into Full Stack Web Development, 
            leveraging my past experience and a commitment to staying updated with current industry trends and technologies.
